# VisionAssistant
Vision Assistant (I name it OIC - Oh! I See) is a web based app programed by Python and HTML/Javascript. 
It could help low vision users to capture a picture and understand what described in the scene via voice from smart phone. 

It uses Ali cloud based AI LLM service to recognize and smartly describe pictures. It has 2 parts of files

Backend - purely use Python to create a serve service for frontend to call, it will call cloud picture recoginition API to generate a description text. 

Frontend - a simple interactive UX to initial client-end phone camera to capture a picture, coding the picture data and call backend service, once receiving AI described text, it will convert it to voice and play. 

Note - curretnly the recoginized description only supports Chinese, and the voice will be in Chinses as well.
